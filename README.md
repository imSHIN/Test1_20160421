# Test1_20160421

Write a super class named SuperList, within which there is a method that returns true if two arrays (list1 and list2) are strictly identical (two arrays list1 and list2 are strictly identical if they have the same length and list1[i] is equal to list2[i] for each i.), using the following header:
                      
                      public boolean equal(int[] list1, int[] list2)
                      
Write a child class named ChildList, within which the method equal is overridden, to return true if list1 and list2 are identical, using the same header as above. Only this time, two arrays list1 and list2 are identical if they have the same contents.

Write a test program named TestList that prompts the user to enter two lists of integers (with the size from user input), use the two methods from the super class and child class, respectively, and displays whether the two are strictly identical or identical or neither. Here are two sample runs.
